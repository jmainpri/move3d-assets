Read this file before using theses Model.

Using any move3d model in many scenarios, causes a duplication of datas. The Idea here is to have a directory where the models are stocked, and to create symbolic links to this directory in each custom scenario folder.

For example : In the Move3DDemos folder, my custom scenario is in the directory "custom"
I will need in this directory a MACROS folder, and at least one p3d file 'custom.p3d'

To use the any object model or scene, first step is to put symbolic links to the folder Object

The command to do that is :

cd ~/Move3DDemos/custom/MACROS;
ln -s  ../../Objects .;

Then write your p3d file as usual. You can access to the objects in the p3d file by : ./Object/Static/myObject.macro

If no one of the present objects macros corresponds to what you want to do, create a new one in Static or Movable Folder or if you want to create a scene in the root of "./Object". DO NOT CREATE IT IN YOU CUSTOM SCENARIO FOLDER !!!!

Thanks to respect this.
