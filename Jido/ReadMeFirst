Read this file before using the Jido Model.

Using any move3d robot model in many scenarios, causes a duplication of datas. The Idea here is to have a directory where the robot model is stocked, and to create symbolic links to this directory in each custom scenario folder.

For example : In the Move3DDemos folder, my custom scenario is in the directory "custom"
I will need in this directory a MACROS folder, and at least one p3d file 'custom.p3d'

To use the new model of jido, first step is to put symbolic links to the folders inside Jido/MACROS.

The command to do that is :

cd ~/Move3DDemos/custom/MACROS;
ln -s  ../../Jido/MACROS/JidoParts .;

Then, create a symbolic link to the macro of jido that you want to use in you scenario

ln -s  ../../Jido/MACROS/jidoHriGripper.macro .;

Then write your p3d file as usual.



If no one of the present jido macros correspond to what you want to do, create a new one in the Jido/MACROS Folder. DO NOT CREATE IT IN YOU CUSTOM SCENARIO FOLDER !!!!

If you have to add some parts in jido, add the bodies into the correct folders.

Thanks to respect this.
